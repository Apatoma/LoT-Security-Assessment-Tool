Installation

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone  https://github.com/Apatoma/LoT-Security-Assessment-Tool.git
cd LoT-Security-Assessment-Tool

Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):

bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
